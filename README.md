# google_traffic
Gathering and Analyzing Traffic Data from Google Map's API

I have my crontab setup to run the following:

*/10 11-15 * * 1-5 /usr/bin/python travel_times.py to_work

*/10 19-23 * * 1-5 /usr/bin/python travel_times.py from_work

And then I run the r script from time to time to update graphs
